# Web Programming

This is my repository for webdesign this semester I will regularly 
be making changes and updates to it every week with work form labs and other code

I have one folder which I am using to keep some examples from lectures in that I might find useful and can refer to in the future for projects or revision. 
My 3 main files index.html, css.css and java.js will be used by me to make a page filled of different general web features that I want to try out and practise, hopefully by the end of the semester I will have an almost full website using all these features.
My second folder is for any images that i will be using for the website so they can stay seperte and organised from everything else.
