Week 2 
This week I have made a readme file along with html, css and javascript files and have started to impliment some code, I have made and styled a button with html and css and I am planning to use javascript to make an aspect of it change when it is pressed by he user.
As well as that I created a folder within my repository for some of the example code we have been given in lectures so I can refer back to it for help if needed at any point.
