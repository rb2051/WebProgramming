Week 2 
This week I have made a readme file along with html, css and javascript files and have started to impliment some code, I have made and styled a button with html and css and I am planning to use javascript to make an aspect of it change when it is pressed by he user.
As well as that I created a folder within my repository for some of the example code we have been given in lectures so I can refer back to it for help if needed at any point.

Week 3
This week I have a scrolling title to my main page, I have also created an automatic slideshow of pictures using JavaScript and the text on my button now changes when it is clicked. I have also just added dragable items, my goal for next week is to make a place for them to be dropped into. I have also added some other lecture examples about arrays. I now have seperate folder for imagaes I will be using throughout the semester to keep them seperate and my repository organised.
